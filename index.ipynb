    "Waldo Tobler (1970)\n",

    "Spatial autocorrelation has to do with the degree to which the similarity in values between observations in a dataset is related to the similarity in locations of such observations. Not completely unlike the traditional correlation between two variables -which informs us about how the values in one variable change as a function of those in the other- and analogous to its time-series counterpart -which relates the value of a variable at a given point in time with those in previous periods-, spatial autocorrelation relates the value of the variable of interest in a given location, with values of the same variable in surrounding locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key idea in this context is that of *spatial randomness*: a situation in which the location of an observation gives no information whatsoever about its value. In other words, a variable is spatially random if it is distributed following no discernible pattern over space. Spatial autocorrelation can thus be formally defined as the \"absence of spatial randomness\", which gives room for two main classes of autocorrelation, similar to the traditional case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Positive** spatial autocorrelation: similar values tend to group together in similar locations.\n",
    "* **Negative** spatial autocorrelation: similar values tend to be dispersed and further apart from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the concept using some of the widgets available in the Jupyter Notebook. Thanks to the interactivity they afford, it is possible to modify the degree of spatial autocorrelation embedded in a synthetic variable that is generated, mapped, and displayed in the so called Moran Plot."

You can modify the value in the horizontal slider to control how spatially correlated the resulting map will be: 0 implies complete spatial randomness; 0.9 is a high degree of positive spatial autocorrelation; and -0.9 represents extremely high negative spatial autocorrelation.\n",
